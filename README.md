Probing cell division under changing environments


A. Mean interdivision time vs. mean growth rate
   No deviation from expected curve in fluc conditions
   - note: currently interdiv time is cleaned by removing outliers beyond 3 std
   - note: growth rate is not cleaned up in a similar way, however

A2. Mean birth size vs. mean growth rate
   No deviation from expected curve in fluc conditions
   - note: currently interdiv time is cleaned by removing outliers beyond 3 std
   - note: growth rate is not cleaned up in a similar way, however

A3. Birth size vs growth rate
    Population-level and single-cell level
    Looks to mirror Figure 1C from Taheri-Araghi et al., Current Biology 2014
    In this script, only growth rates corresponding to cell cycles in analysis are considered.

A5. Heated scatter plots of the bins plotted in A3;
	Over the same points (birth volume/length vs mean growth rate), colormap indicates:
		1. counts (number of cell cycles per bin)
		2. mean nScore
		3. frequency of nutrient signal 

A6. like A5, heated scatter plots but tau vs lambda
	(interdivision time vs mean growth rate across cell cycle)
	
A7. like A5, heated scatter plots but for added size vs lambda
	(looks at added volume and added length)

B1. Mean division size vs mean birth size, population level


B2. Division size vs. birth size, single-cell (heated scatter plot)
	- trimmed for steady-state (post 3 hrs) based on birth time
	- for prior to steady-state, trimming by birth time gives 2x
	- for prior to steady-state, trimming by division time (< 2.5h) gives....
	- plots each replicate from desired timescale

B3. Heated scatter plot, interdivision time vs mean growth rate per cell cycle
	- compiling all replicates
B4. Heated scatter plot, birth size vs lambda
	- compiling all replicates
B5. Heated scatter, birth size vs lambda for individual replicates
	- 5 min timescale when compiled has two peaks, whereas for individual replicates each has only one


C1. Traits associated with being above or below average in interdivision size
	- isolates two populations from each condition: (1) one std larger than average division size and (2) one std smaller than average division size
	- compares traits between the two subpopulations for all conditions

	- main findings:
	i. interdivions are longer in cells that divide larger (fluc), whereas in steady interdivs ~ equal
	ii. mean growth rate is higher in cells that divide smaller (fluc), whereas in steady ~ equal
	iii. both of these are consistent with steady-state relationships between growth rate and interdivision time
	-- overall: this represents a regulation at the single cell level



C2. Traits binned by nutrient phase at birth
	- nutrient phase defines the start of the low as the first bin (bin 1) and the start of the high being the the start of the second half of bins (if 24 bins total, high phase starts at bin 13) 
	- quite difficult to look at, due to lack of data throughout the period



D. Bootstrap hypothesis testing of test statistics between a single lineage and random subsamples from the whole population.
	- performed for 2, 4, and 5-cell cycle lineages
	- for each lineage found in dataset, control for possible entrainment from nutrient signal by pulling out random subsamples with the same spread of nutrient signal classifications as the lineage set.

D2. Autocorrelation analysis of trait parameters.
	- both D analyses look for history effects between generations
	- which is more prominent? nutrient experience of the cell cycle? or co-variance within a lineage?
	- calculates two stats:
	-    R1 : correlation coefficient for daughter vs mom
	-    R2 : correlation coefficient for grand-daugther vs grandma





E & F. assess traits by nutrient signal classifications
		- classifications are performed by sectioning signal into 5ths
		- these 5ths are assigned "high" or "low" based on the majority signal
		- the binary sequence of these fifths are given a class number, by which cell cycles are binned
		- the cell cycle stats or "traits" are measured then for each class bin

		Program E does one condition per designated set of experiments and produces a plot for each experiment, of trait mean and stdev by class.

		Program F compiles cell cycles from each listed experiment and produces a single plot for all data. This plot compares signals by splitting classifications into two more data points:
			1. fraction of signal spent in high
			2. signal type: low to high, high to low, high-low-high, low-high-low

		Both programs, given the manner in which classifications are defined, only function with data from 60 min periods. A new classification scheme needs to be developed to consider other data, including 15 min periods.



G. size vs time (at birth, at division, added)
	- what is the timescales at which cell size stabilizes? how does it compare with that of mu?
	- to get at this, four plots:
	1. birth size vs time at birth
	2. division size vs time at division
	3. added size vs time at birth
	4. added size vs time at division



H. traits plotted over a continuous nScore axis, though segregated by nutrient signal type
	- type 1 = high to low
	- type 2 = low to high
	- type 3 = high low high
	- type 4 = low high low

	This script takes all 60 min experiments and pools data to plot a scatter of each cell cycle's trait value over its nutrient score. Traits include: division size, interdivision time, ratio of division size and birth size, added size, and mean growth rate.



I. comparing trait values between steady-state low and 0% nutrient, steady-state ave and 50%, and steady-state high and 100% nutrient.
	- Mann-Whitney U test does not find any significance between bars of comparable nutrient experience. (lowest is p = 0.08q) 



J. two-factor ANOVA
   tests for interactions between nutrient level and nutrient timescale


K. Taheri-like added volume vs birth size plots
   modified from figure28.m, which is about 1 year old at this point
   add number of cell cycles per bin to plot (overlaid histogram)



L. Mean added volume vs mean birth volume, at population level
   Also plots mean added volume vs mean interdivision time
