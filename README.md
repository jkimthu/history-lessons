Probing cell division under changing environments


A. Mean interdivision time vs. mean growth rate
   No deviation from expected curve in fluc conditions
   - note: currently interdiv time is cleaned by removing outliers beyond 3 std
   - note: growth rate is not cleaned up in a similar way, however

A2. Mean birth size vs. mean growth rate
   No deviation from expected curve in fluc conditions
   - note: currently interdiv time is cleaned by removing outliers beyond 3 std
   - note: growth rate is not cleaned up in a similar way, however


B1. Mean division size vs mean birth size, population level


B2. Division size vs. birth size, single-cell


C1. Traits associated with being above or below average in interdivision size
	- isolates two populations from each condition: (1) one std larger than average division size and (2) one std smaller than average division size
	- compares traits between the two subpopulations for all conditions

	- main findings:
	i. interdivions are longer in cells that divide larger (fluc), whereas in steady interdivs ~ equal
	ii. mean growth rate is higher in cells that divide smaller (fluc), whereas in steady ~ equal
	iii. both of these are consistent with steady-state relationships between growth rate and interdivision time
	-- overall: this represents a regulation at the single cell level
