Probing cell division under changing environments


A. Mean interdivision time vs. mean growth rate
   No deviation from expected curve in fluc conditions
   - note: currently interdiv time is cleaned by removing outliers beyond 3 std
   - note: growth rate is not cleaned up in a similar way, however

A2. Mean birth size vs. mean growth rate
   No deviation from expected curve in fluc conditions
   - note: currently interdiv time is cleaned by removing outliers beyond 3 std
   - note: growth rate is not cleaned up in a similar way, however


B1. Mean division size vs mean birth size, population level


B2. Division size vs. birth size, single-cell





B. Distributions of interdivision times binned by nutrient phase at birth
